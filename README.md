# Pokedex

This project is a "Pokemon Pokedex" project created with [JavaScript/Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## How it works
It's a project that fetches data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and displays it on screen. You currently can render up to 100 Pokemon with each pokemon being randomly selected.

## How it looks
Here is a current preview of the project (There are currently bugs, but it won't look like this in the final version):
